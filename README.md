## If you want throw in your style sheet and maybe use some comments to split it to define where me styling goes Vs. yours
## Zack Spent the week end trying to fix the carousel.  I am missing something.  It will not recognize the second slide on.

## if you find the solution please let me know.
##Sorry for a late response and such but i wasnt able to find the error in the carousel but i did finish the purchase.html
##Also on the index.html i can not find why but the'purchase' link does not lead to the other page even with the name correct.
##We'll need to re submit the files as i got up a bit early and finally pushed my finished stuff to the github so it's not in ##there.
